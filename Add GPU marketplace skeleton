# GPU Market — GPU buying/selling marketplace (prototype)

This repository is a small, opinionated starter for a GPU buy/sell marketplace inspired by `gpused.co.uk`.

Features:
- Simple REST API (Express + SQLite)
- Static Bootstrap frontend that consumes the API
- Seed data and instructions to run locally or with Docker

This is a prototype skeleton intended as a starting point for a full project.

## Quick start (local)

Prerequisites: Node.js 18+, npm

1. Start the backend and seed the database:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run seed
npm start
```

2. Open the frontend:

Open `frontend/index.html` in your browser (it talks to `http://localhost:3000`). For full CORS-free experience, serve the `frontend` folder with a simple static server or let Docker serve it.

## Docker

Build and run:

```bash
docker build -t gpu-market .
docker run -p 3000:3000 gpu-market
```

## Project layout

- `backend/` — Express API and SQLite database
- `frontend/` — Static Bootstrap + JS frontend
